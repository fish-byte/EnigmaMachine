# EnigmaMachine
The Enigma machine was used during World II by the germans to encrypt the messages 
they would send.

Alan Turing who some say is the father of computer science broke the code and with the
help of a fellow code breaker Gordon Welchman built the Bombe which deciphered the messages.

Alan Turing cracked the code because it had one flaw, the flaw was a letter could never
be itself.
